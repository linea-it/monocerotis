	"abstract": "The talk will present a discussion about how science is changing, results in data sets with an ever longer effective lifetime. Many of the current sky-surveys (and other mid-scale projects) generate data sets at a cost of tens to hundreds of millions of dollars, yet there is no coherent strategy to ensure the survival of these data sets.  WE will discuss the different factors related to long term data preservation, the technological changes, and the sociological changes in how data is used, including AI applications.",

Taking the eScience and DiRAC Institutes at the University of Washington as exemplars, I will discuss the opportunities and challenges building data science communities in the context of the data-intensive astrophysics expected from a new generation of facilities such as the Rubin Observatory and Roman Space Telescope. Programs to develop tools and techniques that can scale to the volume and complexity of the LSST,  educational frameworks that can train researchers in data science methodologies and applications, and mechanisms by which we can share our ideas and expertise (both within and beyond astrophysics) will all need to be part of any data science institute. I will end by describing some of the needs that are emerging across a range of disciplines as we start to scale our science and where astronomy might look to draw on the experience of the broader research community.",

	"abstract": "ESA’s Euclid dark energy mission will release about 10 Pbytes of images and catalogues at the end of six years of operations, currently planned to start in 2022. Even if the data rate will not be the most extreme (approximately 200 Gbyte per day of raw science data), Euclid is expected to generate a 24/7 data flow for 6 years to cover eventually an area of 15,000 deg^{2} in optical imaging, near-infrared imaging photometry and near-infrared spectroscopy, with space-based spatial resolution. These data will be combined with g,r,i and z-band ground-based optical photometry, covering the same sky as Euclid. Key elements are the accessible archive with its data products, the scientific validations, and user support providing knowledge and, possibly, advanced remote processing facilities. We will review these key elements from a Euclid perspective and discuss the possible use of the ESA Datalabs platform for facilitating and maximising the scientific return from this high-quality space-grade data deluge.",

	"abstract": "In the era of big data astronomy, next generation telescopes and large sky surveys produce data sets at the TB or even PB level. Due to their large data volumes, these astronomical data sets are extremely difficult to transfer and analyze using personal computers or small clusters. In order to offer better access to data, data centers now generally provide online science platforms that enable analysis close to the data. The Chinese Virtual Observatory (China-VO) is one of the member projects in the International Virtual Observatory Alliance and it is dedicated to providing a research and education environment where globally distributed astronomy archives are simple to find, access, and interoperate. In this study, we summarize highlights of the work conducted at the China-VO, as well the experiences and lessons learned during the full life-cycle management of astronomical data. Finally, We discuss the challenges and future trends for astronomical science platforms.",

That is complemented by work on a software infrastructure, enabling the sharing of the research tools and products, an integration of the International Virtual Observatory (IVOA) framework into the proto-EOSC and high level science platforms.  ESCAPE is currently planning two science challenges; one on Dark Matter, and the second on Gravitational Waves and the Extreme Universe, which together will demonstrate the capabilities of open data and cross-domain science.

Our unique setup uses an IDIA cloud-based platform running on hardware provided by the ilifu national facility, taking advantage of cluster-level parallelism, resource management and software containers.

ESA's Euclid mission is scheduled for launch in 2023. The SciPIC scientific pipeline has been developed to efficiently generate mock galaxy catalogs using as input a dark matter halo population. It runs on top of the Hadoop platform using Apache Spark, which is an open-source cluster-computing framework. Different Euclid teams have created the largest simulated galaxy catalog ever produced: the Euclid Flagship mock galaxy catalog. The simulation reproduces with high accuracy both the shear pattern and the galaxy clustering down to small scales. Also the simulation mimics complex properties that real sources exhibit, such as their shapes, colours and luminosities. During the talk I will describe CosmoHub and the process of generating the Euclid Flagship mock galaxy catalogue.",
